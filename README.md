 This is expermental code for the integration of different attention mechanisms in a transformer whisper-like model. 
 Although everything runs and works the code is not complete and is meant to be used as a reference for further development.
 The idea is to create a transformer model that can learn from different attention mechanisms and combine them to improve performance.
 This model includes the following attention mechanisms:
 1. Dynamic Convolutional Attention
 2. Hybrid Attention
 3. Biased Attention
 4. Augmented Memory
 5. Rotary and Learned Sinusoidal Embeddings
 Other components like LayerNorm, GroupNorm(RMS), custom linear and conv1 blocks and MLP are also included to complete the transformer block.
 The code is written in PyTorch and is meant to be used as a reference for further development and experimentation. Training loop and data processing are not included in 
 pytorch with optional adaptation for hugging face trainer and datasets.
 The code is not optimized and is meant for educational purposes only.

 The goal is to integrate these mechanisms into a single transformer block that can leverage the strengths of each attention mechanism to improve performance on various 
 tasks.   

 1. Dynamic Convolutional Attention and Hybrid Attention
 Natural Synergy: Dynamic convolutional attention can adapt convolutional filters based on the input, providing a local context that hybrid attention can leverage. Combining 
 these can enhance both global and local context understanding.

 Integration Idea: Use dynamic convolutional attention within the local convolution part of the hybrid attention mechanism. This way, the dynamic adjustments made by the 
 convolutional attention can be directly utilized by the hybrid attention layers.

 2. Biased Attention and Augmented Memory
 Natural Synergy: Biased attention can prioritize important features, while augmented memory can store and retrieve long-term dependencies. Together, they can ensure that 
 important features are not only highlighted but also remembered over long sequences.

 Integration Idea: Embed bias terms in the augmented memory retrieval process, allowing the model to focus on and recall important features over extended periods.

 3. Rotary and Learned Sinusoidal Embeddings with Hybrid Attention
 Natural Synergy: Rotary and learned sinusoidal embeddings enhance positional encoding, which can be crucial for hybrid attention mechanisms that need to maintain the order 
 of information while attending to both local and global contexts.

 Integration Idea: Apply rotary and learned sinusoidal embeddings within the hybrid attention layers to improve positional awareness and ensure the model accurately captures 
 the order and structure of the input data.
